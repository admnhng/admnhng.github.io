    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 20, 2026</p>

    <p>We respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Summa</strong> ("the App", "we", "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our Safari Web Extension and iOS Application.</p>

    <p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect & How We Use It</h2>
    <p>We operate on a <strong>privacy-first, stateless architecture</strong>. We minimize data collection to the absolute necessity required to provide the summarization service.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Webpage Content (Text):</strong> When you actively trigger the extension (via the Floating Button or Toolbar), we temporarily process the text content of the current webpage to generate a summary. <span class="highlight">We do NOT store this text.</span> It is discarded immediately after processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Browsing History:</strong> We do <span class="highlight">NOT</span> track, store, or sell your browsing history. The extension only accesses the specific page you explicitly choose to summarize.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect your device's language setting to provide summaries in your preferred language.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Data:</strong> We collect anonymous receipt data (via Apple StoreKit) to validate your "Pro" subscription status or Free Trial eligibility. This does not include your personal identity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. AI Processing & Third Parties</h2>
    <p>To provide high-quality summaries, we utilize third-party services. Data is transmitted securely via HTTPS.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cloudflare Workers:</strong> Acts as our secure gateway. It processes requests transiently and does not retain your data.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Gemini (AI Model):</strong> The text content is sent to Google's Generative AI for summarization. According to Google's API data policy, this data is <strong>not used to train their models</strong> and is not stored long-term.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not retain your data.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The text you send for summarization is processed in memory and deleted immediately after the summary is returned to your device.</li>
        <li>We do not have a user database, login system, or user profiles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. App Store Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>All financial transactions are handled directly by <strong>Apple</strong> via the App Store. We do not have access to your credit card information or billing address. We only receive a cryptographic receipt to verify if your subscription is active.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures, including encryption in transit (TLS/SSL), to protect your data while it travels between your device, our serverless backend, and the AI provider.</p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please <a href="https://admnhng.github.io/contact_us.html"><strong>contact us</strong></a>.</p>
